# Movie Genre Classification Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models

## Abstract:

Custom Multiple Genre Classification
The task of movie genre classification involves
categorizing movie plots into predefined genres based on their textual descriptions. This
project compares the performance of baseline
models including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
against the advanced BERT model. While the
baseline models provide a solid starting point
for genre classification, the BERT model and
the DistilBert models, fine-tuned for this specific task, demonstrates superior performance.
Using the ”Wiki Movie Plots” dataset, we
evaluate the models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This comparative analysis enhances our understanding of
the strengths and limitations of traditional and
deep learning approaches in the context of
movie genre classification.

## Dataset:
I will use publicly available datasets containing movie plots and their associated genres.
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains 34,886 movie
descriptions scraped from Wikipedia.
